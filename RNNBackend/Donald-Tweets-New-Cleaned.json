I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!","30111":"Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win.

FAKE NEWS!","30118":"Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media.

Jobs are roaring back!","30159":"Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama.

In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!","32396":"The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else\u2019s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It\u2019s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, &amp; technology.....","32397":"Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything.

Not good!","32407":"With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans?

Good luck!","32435":"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!","32436":"Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely &amp; illegally deleted.

It stops looking like prosecution and more looking like......","32447":"The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now.

China made $517 Billion on us last year.","33897":"When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!","33898":"Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!","33899":"\u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton &amp; Frame Donald Trump\u201d is a Hot Seller, already Number One!

Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won\u2019t!","33906":"I\u2019m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election.

Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!","33911":"Tariffs are the greatest!

Remember, we are the \u201cpiggy bank\u201d that\u2019s being robbed. All will be Great!","33912":"Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago but,\nas the saying goes, better late than never!","33916":"....In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?","33917":"The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago.

Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....","33922":"\u201cIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team.

Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!","33938":"The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party\u2019s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the \u201816 Election never ends!","33939":"Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer\u2019s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of.

Second time kneeling, out for season\/no pay!","33941":"I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud &amp; vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!","33943":"Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!","33944":"....The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals.

They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I\u2019ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!","33956":"The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I\u2019ll complain anyway!","33957":"The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms.

They would rather go to war than see this. It\u2019s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!","33966":"Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress.

Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!","33968":"While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting..","33969":"So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki.

Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!","33976":"I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia).

Who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn\u2019t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!","33993":"These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn\u2019t Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that\u2019s why.

ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.","34082":"The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that\u2019s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event, they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!","34083":"I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!","34084":"Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats!","34085":"Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their \u201cleadership\u201d wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law &amp; Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party!","34087":"Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!","34088":"A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now.

Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!","34089":"The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again","34091":"When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!","34093":"Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. Cryin\u2019 Chuck would do it on day one, but we\u2019ll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!","34094":"I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.","34095":"A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, \u201cThe Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President.\u201d It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!","34096":"I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday, July 9th!","34097":"Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil &amp; disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!","34098":"To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!","34099":"The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!","34103":"Prior to departing Wisconsin, I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.

A disgraceful situation!","34108":"When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and......","34109":"Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller\/Comey best friends!","34112":"Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn\u2019t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn\u2019t Hillary\/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!","34113":"Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday\u2019s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!","34114":"...home addresses \u2013 putting these selfless public servants in harm\u2019s way. These radical protesters want ANARCHY \u2013 but the only response they will find from our government is LAW AND ORDER!","34115":"In recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous law enforcement officers. Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE.

I\u2019ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won\u2019t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!","34123":"Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!","34124":"HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON\u2019T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!","34125":"Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I\u2019m not going anywhere!","34126":"Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.","34129":"The Democrats are in Turmoil! Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!","34130":"Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi\u2019s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he\u2019s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!","34131":"Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan.

Wow!","34135":"\u201cThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?\u201d  Judge Andrew Napolitano","34136":"The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.","34137":"A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!","34138":"It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!","34139":"....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won\u2019t take very long!","34140":"....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won\u2019t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!","34141":"....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!","34142":"Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs\/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....","34144":"Just landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly! #MAGA","34145":"The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI &amp; DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!","34146":"Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn\u2019t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?","34148":"Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!  #MAGA","34149":"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!","3415":"Now is the time to buy housing, before values have fully recovered. In 5 years, remember I told you so.","34150":"Will be heading to one of my favorite places, South Carolina, to fight for one of my original \u201cfighters,\u201d Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 7:00 P.M.","34151":"....If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it\u2019s tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!","34152":"Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......","34153":"Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!","34154":"I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp; FBI aren\u2019t giving over requested documents?","34155":"The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!","34156":"Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!","34158":"House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don\u2019t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!","34161":"The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!","34162":"....Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!","34163":"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...","34164":"Democrats, fix the laws. Don\u2019t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!","34169":"It\u2019s very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!","34170":"Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country\u2019s economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well.","34172":"...everyone how much he likes me, but he will only vote with Nancy Pelosi.

Need to keep prices down!","34185":"We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!","34186":"80% of Mexico\u2019s Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us, which is fine with me. They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!","34187":"Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida.

I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!","34190":"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen\/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!","34191":"Elect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!","34192":"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - &amp; the Dems are Obstructionists who won\u2019t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don\u2019t care about Crime coming from Border!

It\u2019s a Rigged Witch Hunt, that\u2019s why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!","34447":"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!","34448":"\u201cThis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about.

Solid response to my letter, thank you!","34450":"Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama\u2019s term showing children from the Border in steel cages.

Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn\u2019t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.","34462":"Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself.

We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!","34485":"Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!","34486":"\u201cEveryone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.\u201d Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!","34487":"Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!","34488":"The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party\u2019s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an \u201cInformant\u201d who is paid a fortune and who \u201csets up\u201d way earlier than the Russian Hoax?","34489":"I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!","34496":"Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men &amp; Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE","34497":"Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign.

What goes around, comes around!","34514":"...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion.

Oh\u2019 great!","34531":"....and why hasn\u2019t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm?

They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?","34533":"Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party.

Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.","35266":"Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection.
